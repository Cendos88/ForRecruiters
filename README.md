# ForRecruiters
If you are looking at this you are my friend or recruiter.
This project is for you so you can see how i write code
I will continously add comments on my progress.
I am using MySQL db.
This application will start as a basic internet banking app and we will see what it turns out in the end.
I started with implementing security with spring security and jwt(without refresh token I dont want to ban anyone:-))
Next step will be account service that will provide transactions with fee to the bank interests and some other things that i got in my mind.
I want to have many entities beacouse i want to write as many SQL queries as possible.

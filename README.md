# ForRecruiters
If You are looking at this You are my friend or recruiter.
This project is for You so you can see how I code.
I will continuously add comments on my progress.
I am using MySQL db.
This application will start as a simulation of internet banking app and we will see what it turns out in the end.
I started with implementing security with spring security and jwt(without refresh token I dont want to ban anyone:-))
Next step will be account service that will provide transactions with fee to the bank interests and some other things that I got in my mind.
Today I added  basic account and transaction service functionality and some Exception handling.
Tomorrow I will finish core backend functionality then I will go JavaDays to get some inspiration and I will start frontend at weekend.
Front end will be in challenge because want to do it in React and I have never used it before.
Backends basic functionality is in first version, definitely needs more love.  
But right now  I am really looking forward to react.
